# Product/Project/Service
## Overview
- Amount of literature, frameworks, videos, podcast and resources on product/project/service development and maintenance as well as management is enormous. It may feel overwhelming at first - especially if someone is starting in field of software engineering. The size of most of the frameworks is way too massive, they are too complicated and require learning their own concepts and glossary.. Feels like reinventing the wheel all over.
- Most of us do not need extended and detailed knowledge of those frameworks. Keep in mind that majority of them are business products and are structured to attend a great deal of official trainings, passing certification and re-certification while spending a lot of money.  
- After few years in software engineering I have noticed that no matter how much time I spend on following such resources I always tend to go back to basics. Those basics are much easier to understand and to implement right away.  
- The tool I feel is the most effective (in all areas of my life) is asking questions - that's why I decided to gather in this file all relevant and most powerful questions I use on daily basis while working on product and services in IT.
- No matter if you are PM, developer, TL or UX designer - go through those questions and use them for making your projects waste-free and more focused on value. 
For those who are outside of IT industry - I am 100% sure that you will benefit from reading this list as well and trying my approach in your projects.
## Question list
**ORDER IS RANDOM**
-  What will happen if we won't do this task? (if answer is `nothing` - do not proceed)
- How can we do less? (ex. less tasks, less features, less code)
- If we could just pick one thing to deliver this week/month/day/sprint - what would it be?
- What problem are we solving?
- What is valuable in our product?
- How do we know our product is valuble?
- Are our products delivering value to customers?
- Are we solving customers problems?
- Which tasks can be splitted into smaller, managable pieces?
- Does each splitted task has business value on their own?
- What items/tasks can we remove from our backlog (TODO list)?
- What is our goal for this week/month/quarter?
- What is our product vision?
- Who are our customers and users? 
- What are needs of our customers and users?
- How are we managing risks?
- What is the biggest obstacle we need to tackle in order to succeed?
- What do you (dev team) need in order to succeed?
- How are we tracking our progress?
- How will we know that we have succeeded?
- Who has impact on our work and goals? (stakeholders mapping)
- What has impact on our work and goals? (external and internal factors mapping)
- How do we want/like to work? (setting ways of working)
- How do we evaluate our achievements and failures? (ensuring some kind of PDCA form)
- What are we lacking as a team? (ex. skills, knowledge)
- Who is accountable for `X,Y,Z`? (ex. backlog, product vision, delivery...etc.. - in general mapping structure and creating RACI)
