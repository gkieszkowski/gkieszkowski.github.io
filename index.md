# Overview
- Questions below are the main tool I use on daily basis.
- I hope it will make software engineering management simplified for you.
- Those questions could be also applicable for other industries and areas.
- Order is random.
## Software engineering - Product/Project/Service
### Value
- What problem are we solving?
- What is our product vision?
- What is valuable in our product?
- Who is accountable for setting product vision?
- How do we know our product is valuble?
- Who are our customers and users? 
- What are needs of our customers and users?
- Are our products delivering value to customers?
- Are we solving customers problems?
- What is our goal for this week/month/quarter?
- Who has impact on our work and goals? (stakeholders mapping)
- What has impact on our work and goals? (external and internal factors mapping)
### Performance/Metrics
- How do we evaluate our achievements and failures? (ensuring some kind of PDCA form)
- How will we know that we have succeeded?
- What metrics are we tracking?
- How are we tracking our progress?
- Why are we using those metrics (what for)?
- What is our:
    - Return on Investment (ROI)?
    - Net Promoter Score (NPS)?
    - Lead time
    - Cycle time
    - Throughput
    - Average Work in Progress (number of items) 
### Work/time/scope management
- Who is accountable for `X,Y,Z`? (ex. backlog, product vision, delivery...etc.. - in general mapping structure and creating RACI)
- What will happen if we won't do this task? (if answer is `nothing` - do not proceed)
- How can we do less? (ex. less tasks, less features, less code - lowering `average WIP`) 
- If we could just pick one thing to deliver this week/month/day/sprint - what would it be?
- Which tasks can be splitted into smaller, managable pieces?
- Does each splitted task has business value on their own?
- What items/tasks can we remove from our backlog (TODO list)?
- What is the biggest obstacle we need to tackle in order to succeed?
### Communication
- Is communication in team synchronous or asyncchronous?
- What are communiaction channels between team and stakeholders?
- How roadmap is communicated?
- How changes in scope are communicated?
- How stakeolders are informed on progress/mile stones or priorities shift?
- How work in progress is communicated? (work visualisation tools)
### Risk management
- How are we tracking risks?
- How are we managing risks?
- Who is accountable for risk management?
- Who is risk owner for risk `x,y,z`?
- Which risks have been already mitigated?
- How are we calculating risk score?
- Who is contributing to risk management?
### Team
- How do we want/like to work? (setting ways of working)
- What are we lacking as a team? (ex. skills, knowledge)
- What can we do to eliminate our weaknesses?
- What is our biggest strength and what is our biggest weakness?
- What do we (dev team) need in order to succeed?
- If we could implement one change in next iteration - what would it be?
